The data files contain the site frequency spectrums of the simulations and are named based on the parameters input for each simulation. For example, "theta2_nu2-3_psi1-12_r0_n10_runs100000.txt" is the data from a simulation with replication-dependent mutation rate theta=2, replication-independent mutation rate nu=2/3, constant pairwise coalescence rate c or psi=1/12 (r=0), n=10 lineages, and 100,000 runs and "theta2_nu2-3_psi1_1-12_r2_n100_runs100000.txt" is the data from a simulation with theta=2, nu=2/3, fluctuating pairwise coalescence rates between c1=1 and c2=1/12 at rate r=2 starting with c1, n=100, and 100,000 runs.
